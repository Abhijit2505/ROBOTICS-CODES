# ROBOTICS-CODES
This repository contains my robotics practice codes.

I have prepared two **Line Follower Bot** prototypes by using *Arduino* and *AVR* microcontroller.
Also, I have sucessfully made two **Bluetooth Controlled Bot**, using *HC-05* and *DTMF* module along with both Arduino and AVR.

I have provided the code for all the models here.
Arduino codes are written on **Arduino IDE** and AVR codes were written by using **AVR Studio 4**.
